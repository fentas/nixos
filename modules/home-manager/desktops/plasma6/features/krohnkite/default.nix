# In your Home Manager configuration (e.g., users/fentas/home.nix or a relevant module)
{ pkgs, config, lib, ... }:
{

  # Install Krohnkite package
  home.packages = [ pkgs.kwin-scripts-krohnkite ];

  # Manage Krohnkite's configuration file
  # 1. COPY your existing ~/.config/krohnkiterc file into your Nix repo
  #    (e.g., save it as ./dotfiles/kde/krohnkiterc relative to this .nix file)
  # 2. Tell Home Manager to link it into place:
  xdg.configFile."krohnkiterc".source = ./dotfiles/kde/krohnkiterc; # Adjust source path as needed

  # Manage KWin's configuration to enable the script
  # 1. COPY your existing ~/.config/kwinrc file into your Nix repo
  #    (e.g., save it as ./dotfiles/kde/kwinrc)
  # 2. Ensure it has something like this inside (verify your file):
  #    [Plugins]
  #    krohnkiteEnabled=true
  # 3. Tell Home Manager to link it:
  xdg.configFile."kwinrc".source = ./dotfiles/kde/kwinrc; # Adjust source path

  # NOTE: Managing kwinrc this way overwrites the whole file.
  # More advanced merging is possible using home.file.<path>.text and reading/templating,
  # or potentially the experimental plasma.kconfig options, but managing the source
  # file is often the most reliable starting point.
